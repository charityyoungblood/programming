1. What is a variable?

  - Variables are a way for us to store data; they are the memory locations which hold data to be used by any program
  - Professional definition: a variable is a storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value

2. Variable Naming 

  - lower cased letters
  - Snake Case is used to name variables in Ruby (i.e. make_music, i_love_shrimp)
  - A Ruby variable cannot start with a number, be a Ruby reserved word, or have punctuation or space characters.
  - if you are creating a variable without an initial value, set variable to nil (i.e. songs = nil)
    
3. Variable Data Types 

  - Booleans
  - Symbols
  - Integers and Floating Point Numbers
  - Strings
