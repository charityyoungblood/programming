1. What is a method?

  - Methods define a new thing that your program can do. 
  - A method is a set of expressions that returns a value. 
  
2. Why should we use methods?

  - With methods, one can organize their code into subroutines that can be easily invoked from other areas of their program 
  - Other languages sometimes refer to this as a function. A method may be defined as a part of a class or separately.

3. Defining a method
  - use the 'def' keyword, followed by the method name
  - methods are closed with the 'end' keyword 
  
  - Ex:  def greeting => this line is called the Method Signature - it defines the basic properties of the method
         puts "Hello World" => this line is the Method Body
         end  => this line is the Method Closing

  - A good practice is to define the method and then immediately close it before programming anything into the method.
